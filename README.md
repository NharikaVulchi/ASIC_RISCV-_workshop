Introduction to RISC-V
</summary>
RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) designed with simplicity and versatility. It features a modular structure, enabling custom extensions for diverse applications. Its load-store memory model and compact register set streamline execution. Privilege levels ensure secure operation. RISC-V suits embedded systems to high-performance computing, fostering innovation through open collaboration and customization.

Applications to Hardware: There are 3 major steps of how an application can be run on hardware, which are as follows:

**Operating System:**

Interface between hardware and user.

**Compiler**

Converts the high level language to respective instruction set which are hardware specific such as MIPS, Intel or RISC-V. 

**Assembler**

Converts the output from compiler, to binary language which are further fed to the hardware.
